## Clarity Icon Script Tester

To run this, you'll need to build the icons locally and link the dist/clr-icons using `npm link`. Then clone this repo, run `npm link @clr/icons` to get that build loaded into this project. Finally, run `npm run serve` in one tab, and `npm run test` in another to start Cypress. Once Cypress opens, select 'Run all specs'.
